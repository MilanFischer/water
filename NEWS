-----------------------------------------------------------------

VERSION 0.6

* Added a new function loadImageSR to load surface reflectance from
  Landsat 8 from ESPA files
* calcSR only works for L7
* calcTOAr() now estimates TOA reflectance for Landsat 8
* surfaceTemperature() uses the scene in DN and estimates the brightness
  temperature for Landsat 7 or 8. Argument thermalband is deprecated.
* Added a new example of weather station for the new Landsat 8 example
* Added a Landsa 8 scene as example dataset in raw format complete with the
  surface reflectance estimated by ESPA
* Added a new vignette describing how to use Landsat 8 data in water package

VERSION 0.5.1

* Fixed checkSRTMgrids for positives values of lat/long.
* Small improvement in waterWeatherStation plot. Now the time axis is always 
  complete.
* Added daily summary for WeatherStation objects
* Fixed minor bug in vignette

VERSION 0.5

* Added maxit parameter to calcH to control the maximun number of iterations.
* Added an optional constrain to the selection of anchors pixels using the 
  location of the weather station and a 30km buffer.
* Changed default value for Z.om.ws in calcH. (From 0.0018 to 0.03)
* Added a new parameter to calcAnchors, available for both methods: buffer.
  buffer allow to set the minimun distance between two anchor pixels of the same
  kind
* Added a new method for calcAnchors = "CITRA-MCBbc". This method chooses the 
  coldest and hottest anchors pixels availables. Previous method ("CITRA-MCBr")
  chooses random pixel who meets the conditions. CITRA-MCBbc is now the default
  method for calcAnchors
* General remote sensing functions moved to a separate file
* loadImage detects when there is more than 1 image on the working folder
* Rn, G, H, LE are restricted to values > 0
* Improvements to anchors pixels selection: more releaxed hot 
  temperature criterium, distance, mean of many pixels, etc
* Added two methods for land surface estimation: single channel and split windows.
  Split windows only works for Landsat 8.
* loadImage now loads thermal data also: low gain for L7 and both bands for L8
* Fixed big bug when estimating ETo with a large weather station file

VERSION 0.3.2

* Solved errors when using non ASCII characters
* Fixes some bug who prevent using water with L8 data
* More flexibility on band names and changes to reflect the changes on USGS's 
  ESPA file naming
* Improvement to plot.waterWeatherStation to plot only data from the sattelite
  overpass when the object was created using a MTL file.

VERSION 0.3

* First release to CRAN!

VERSION 0.2.9

* Added dailyET function to calc and sum hourly ET for a complete day
* Added new parameter to hourlyET and dailyET to choose between ETo or ETr
* read.WSdata doesn't require a Landsat metadata anymore. Now you can process
  weatherstation data without a landsat flyby. print method changed to reflect
  this
* function METRIC.EB now accepts many parameters for method of the included 
  functions. For example, you can set with method you choose for LAI estimation
* We're approaching CRAN launch date. Changed version numbering to reflect this. 
  First CRAN version will be 0.3

VERSION 0.0.2.4

* Added function to prepare data from Weather Station and calc weather
  conditions at satellite flyby.
* Added function to calculate Surface Energy Balance using METRIC

VERSION 0.0.2.3

* Rename sensibleHeatFlux() to sensibleHeatFlux_old()
* Remove sensibleHeatFlux.CITRA()
* Split sensibleHeatFlux in 2 new functions:
  - calcAnchors() for anchors points
  - calcH() for the iterative process to calculate H and dT
* Added function to estimate Net Radiation
